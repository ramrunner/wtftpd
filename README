WTFtpd v0.1

by spiros thanasoulas <dsp@2f30.org>

The Weekend TFTPd server is a small proof of concept implementation of the TFTP 
protocol. It stores file only in memory but the user can initialize it by scanning
a directory tree. It can log requests on a file apart from the normal logging on
stdout. It also includes a small client implementation that is only used for
black box testing.

Installation:
make

Usage of ./wtftpd:
  -dir string
        directory to scan for files to load (default ".")
  -ip string
        ip to listen on (default "localhost")
  -logfile string
        the logfile that intercepted requests are stored (default "wtftpd.log")
  -loglvl string
        log levels: error/debug/trace (default "error")
  -port int
        daemon listening port (default 69)
